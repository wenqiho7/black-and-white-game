# black-and-white-game
Inspired by Korean game show, The Genius
## Project Concept
This is a strategic match between two players, often played on the Korean gameshow, Genius.

In Black and White, players each start off with 99 points. In every round, players will deduct points from their point bank to face off with the opponent. Each player will alternate in going first to deduct points. The player presenting the higher number of points would win the round. Winning 5 out of 9 rounds will end the game.

Everytime the first player deducts points from their bank, the opponent will be alerted of a black or white card. A black card signals that the player has put down less than 10 points while a white card indicates that the player has more than 10 points deducted. Additionally, the player's point gauge will drop by every 20 points deducted from the bank. The opponent can then use these information to decide his or her points strategy.
